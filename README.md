# Chia
# This repository contains scripts related to maintaining a CHIA farm.
# The logparser script goes through every harvester/farmer/fullnode in your environment and looks for warnings and errors that need your attention. It also checks system health to make sure they are responding to pings. ICMP will need to be enabled along with DNS for this to function.
